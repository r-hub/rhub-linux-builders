# rhub-linux-builders

[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#active)

> Docker configuration for the Linux builders of the [R-hub package builder](https://builder.r-hub.io/advanced).

Most subfolders correspond to a **platform configuration**, e.g. [debian-gcc-release](https://github.com/r-hub/rhub-linux-builders/tree/master/debian-gcc-release) contains the Dockerfile corresponding to the "Debian Linux, R-release, GCC" platform, whereas [debian-gcc](https://github.com/r-hub/rhub-linux-builders/tree/master/debian-gcc) contains the Dockerfile that's used as base for all Debian GCC platforms, whose Dockerfiles start with `FROM rhub/debian-gcc`.

**If you're interested in _running_ one of the images**, you can get it from **[Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/rhub)** instead of building it yourself. E.g. you could run something like `docker run -ti  rhub/fedora-clang-devel bash`. See table below for links. Also note that the **`rhub` R package** has [helpers to use the images locally from R](https://r-hub.github.io/rhub/articles/local-debugging.html).
